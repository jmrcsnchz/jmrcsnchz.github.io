Currently working as a security consultant at NCC Group. I have three years of experience in penetration tests and security assessments, with my focus mainly on web application security. This blog is a casual space for fun, and does not represent the views of the company I work at. Expect articles on security research, CTFs, technical writeups, and certification reviews.

I also would like to thank my girlfriend for designing the avatar used in this blog site ðŸ’•
